👋 Hi There, Future Women Leaders!

Welcome to The University of Sydney! 🎓💫  
Thank you so much for choosing me as your Women in Engineering buddy!  
I'm genuinely excited to be part of your journey :)  
I know that stepping into campus life is a big deal; it's exciting, overwhelming, and totally unforgettable all at once.  
As someone who has just completed my very first semester (yes, still a baby engineer, lol 😄), I want to share a few survival tips and unexpected gems to help you start strong, stay confident, and have fun while you're at it.  
So, ready to explore? Let's dive in! 🐨📚
