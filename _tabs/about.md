👋 Hi There, Future Women Leaders!

Welcome to The University of Sydney! 🎓💫  
Thank you so much for choosing me as your Women in Engineering buddy!  

I’m genuinely happy to be able to share all of this with you, because during my first semester, I was so grateful for all the advice and support I received from my senior buddy, academic advisor, and fellow students who had already been here a while :)

Their stories and tips helped me feel more prepared and less alone.
So now, I just want to pass it on — hoping that this blog can do the same for you 💛  
I know that stepping into campus life is a big deal; it's exciting, overwhelming, and totally unforgettable all at once.  

You’re not alone in this journey and I’m cheering for you every step of the way!  

So, ready to explore? Let's dive in! 🐨📚
