Hey girls! It’s already Week 2, hope you're starting to find your rhythm and enjoy your classes this semester ❤️❤️❤️
This month, I’d love to share a few things that might be helpful as you continue your journey here in Sydney, here we go! 🥳

# <span style="color: var(--text-accent); font-weight:bold;">Quizzes Prep Tips</span>    
Some of you might have upcoming quizzes, especially in tutorials involving numbers and calculations. Here’s how to prepare:  
Check the Ed discussion board regularly. Sometimes your tutor or lecturer shares important info about quiz logistics, such as:  
- Whether you need to bring your Student ID card  
- Blank paper for rough working  
- 2B pencils or pens  
- Erasers, rulers, etc.  

Calculator rules matter! If calculators are allowed, make sure yours meets the university’s approved model list and has the required sticker.

Last semester, I got my sticker from the Business School building. But this semester, the info has been updated.  
The stickers are available at:  
📍Student Centre (Level 3, Jane Foss Russell Building, G02)  
🗓️From **Monday 1 September – Friday 26 September 2025**  
🔗 You can check the full details [here](https://www.sydney.edu.au/students/exams/calculator-dictionary.html).



# <span style="color: var(--text-accent); font-weight:bold;">Not Sure Who to Ask? Here’s Where to Go!</span>  
In the past, general questions outside your Unit of Study (UoS), like degree-related concerns or admin matters could be posted on Ed via the FEIT Student Portal.  
However, starting **Monday, 21 July 2025**, the Ed Discussion board is no longer be monitored by staff for general queries.  
You can now direct your questions through [Engineering Student Advising Portal](https://forms-records.sydney.edu.au/CMS/form058)  
Or you can also use [The University of Sydney Service Portal](https://sydneyuni.service-now.com/)  
I’ve personally used the Service Portal several times, like when I had questions about an intensive unit and when I needed to update my Unique Student Identifier (USI).  
💬 Based on my experience, their responses were fast and super helpful! ✨



# <span style="color: var(--text-accent); font-weight:bold;">Why You Should Download the Sydney Uni App</span>  
<img src="/assets/img/usydapp.jpeg" alt="usydapp" width="20%">    
The Sydney Uni app is a must-have! It keeps everything about your uni life in one place, from class schedules to campus tools.  
Here’s what you can do with it:  

## <span style="color: var(--text-accent); font-weight:bold;">1. Use Your Digital Library Borrower Card</span>  
You can borrow physical books from the library using the digital Library Borrower Card in the app.  
Here’s how:
- First, search for the book title on the [University Library website](https://www.library.sydney.edu.au)    
- If the book is only available in physical format, the website will tell you which library location and shelf number to visit  
- Once you find the book, check it out by scanning your Library Card through the app  
So convenient!  

## <span style="color: var(--text-accent); font-weight:bold;">2. Emergency Button</span>  
In case of any emergency on campus, just tap the **Emergency menu** in the app and choose **Click to Dial**.  
You can directly call Campus Security or the Emergency line. Quick and easy when time matters most.  

## <span style="color: var(--text-accent); font-weight:bold;">3. Daily Study View</span>  
In the Study section, you’ll find a daily snapshot of:  
- Your upcoming classes  
- Their exact locations  
- A helpful countdown timer until your next class starts!  
A great way to stay on track with your schedule.

## <span style="color: var(--text-accent); font-weight:bold;">4. Stay Updated with Notifications</span>  
Tap the 🔔 icon in the top-right corner of the app. This is where important academic announcements appear.  
Don’t forget to check it regularly so you don’t miss anything important!

The built-in campus map makes it easy to search for classroom numbers or landmarks.
