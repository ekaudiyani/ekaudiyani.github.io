Hey girls! It’s already Week 2, hope you're starting to find your rhythm and enjoy your classes this semester ❤️❤️❤️
This month, I’d love to share a few things that might be helpful as you continue your journey here in Sydney, here we go! 🥳

Some of you might have upcoming quizzes, especially in tutorials involving numbers and calculations. Here’s how to prepare:  
Check the Ed discussion board regularly. Sometimes your tutor or lecturer shares important info about quiz logistics, such as:  
- Whether you need to bring your Student ID card  
- Blank paper for rough working  
- 2B pencils or pens  
- Erasers, rulers, etc.  

Calculator rules matter! If calculators are allowed, make sure yours meets the university’s approved model list and has the required sticker.

Last semester, I got my sticker from the Business School building. But this semester, the info has been updated.  
The stickers are available at:  
📍Student Centre (Level 3, Jane Foss Russell Building, G02)  
🗓️From Monday 1 September – Friday 26 September 2025  
🔗 You can check the full details [here](https://www.sydney.edu.au/students/exams/calculator-dictionary.html).

# <span style="color: var(--text-accent); font-weight:bold;">Not Sure Who to Ask? Here’s Where to Go!</span>  
In the past, general questions outside your Unit of Study (UoS), like degree-related concerns or admin matters could be posted on Ed via the FEIT Student Portal.  
However, starting **Monday, 21 July 2025**, the Ed Discussion board is no longer be monitored by staff for general queries.  
You can now direct your questions through [Engineering Student Advising Portal](https://forms-records.sydney.edu.au/CMS/form058)  
Or you can also use [The University of Sydney Service Portal](https://sydneyuni.service-now.com/)  
I’ve personally used the Service Portal several times, like when I had questions about an intensive unit and when I needed to update my Unique Student Identifier (USI).  
💬 Based on my experience, their responses were fast and super helpful! ✨
