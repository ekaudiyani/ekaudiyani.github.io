Some of you might have upcoming quizzes, especially in tutorials involving numbers and calculations. Here’s how to prepare:  
Check the Ed discussion board regularly. Sometimes your tutor or lecturer shares important info about quiz logistics, such as:  
- Whether you need to bring your Student ID card  
- Blank paper for rough working  
- 2B pencils or pens  
- Erasers, rulers, etc.  

Calculator rules matter! If calculators are allowed, make sure yours meets the university’s approved model list and has the required sticker.
