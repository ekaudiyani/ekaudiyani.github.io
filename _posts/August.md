Hey girls! Itâ€™s already Week 2, hope you're starting to find your rhythm and enjoy your classes this semester.
This month, Iâ€™d love to share a few things that might be helpful as you continue your journey here in Sydney.

##Quiz Prep Tips
Some of you might have upcoming quizzes, especially in tutorials involving numbers and calculations. Hereâ€™s how to prepare:
Check the Ed discussion board regularly â€” sometimes your tutor or lecturer shares important info about quiz logistics, such as:
- Whether you need to bring your Student ID card
- Blank paper for rough working
- 2B pencils or pens
- Erasers, rulers, etc.
  
ðŸ§® Calculator rules matter! If calculators are allowed, make sure yours meets the universityâ€™s approved model list and has the required sticker.
Last semester, I got my sticker from the Business School building. But this semester, the info has been updated â€” the stickers are available at the Student Centre (Level 3, Jane Foss Russell Building, G02) from Monday 1 September â€“ Friday 26 September.
