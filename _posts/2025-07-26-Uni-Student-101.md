Hi, girls welcome to my page, here I'll share everything you need as an international student in USYD.

## 🎓 Getting Ready for Your First Week at Uni!

Your first week at USYD is just around the corner, and I’ve got you covered!
Here are some important things to keep in mind before you dive into the uni life:

### <span style="color:blue; font-weight:bold;">1. Timetable = Your New Best Friend</span>
Make sure you’ve completed your unit enrolment and already got your class schedule sorted. You can check your timetable via [Click here](https://sso.sydney.edu.au/app/sydneyuni_mytimetablesprodnew_1/exk1vh7zb5kdlpsb63l7/sso/saml).  

💡 Pro tip: Download and export your timetable to your phone calendar! It’s a game-changer, you’ll get automatic reminders and daily views of your classes.

If you have a family (like me!), you can even share the calendar with your partner or parents, so they’ll know when you’re in class and when you're free for a quick chat or call. 😉


### <span style="color:blue; font-weight:bold;">2. Know Where Your Classes Are Before Day One</span>

Before classes officially kick off in early August, take some time to check the exact location of your classes. Trust me, this is a lifesaver!

Knowing where your buildings and rooms are ahead of time will help you:
- Estimate how long it’ll take to walk there 🚶‍♀️
- Avoid getting lost (especially on a huge campus like USYD) 🗺️
- Walk into class calm and confident, not sweaty and stressed 😅
💡 Pro tip: Visit campus a few days before and do a little “mini tour” to find your lecture halls and tutorial rooms. It’ll make your first week so much smoother!


### <span style="color:blue; font-weight:bold;">3. Planning Your Study Time & Assignments Like a Pro</span>
In my first semester, I experimented with different ways to manage study time and assignments, it was a bit of trial and error. But halfway through, I finally found a system that really worked for me.

Here’s what I recommend:

Go through the full details of each Unit of Study (UoS).
You can search your units at [click here](https://www.sydney.edu.au/units).

Scroll to the bottom of the page and click "View Outline".
Take your time reading it. Focus especially on the Assessment section. Note down:

- What tasks you’ll need to submit
- The weight
- When each is due
- Don’t skip the assignment summaries, they’ll help you understand what’s expected.

💡 Pro tip: Check the Weekly Schedule to prep for your tutorials and lectures.
Also, take note if there’s a recommended textbook. You can usually get a free soft copy via the library:
🔗 [click here](https://www.library.sydney.edu.au) don’t forget to log in first!

Prefer hardcopy? Just check the book’s location online and grab it from the library in person.  

In my case, I made a simple Excel sheet to help me keep track of deadlines and weekly goals, it’s nothing fancy, but it kept me sane!  
Let me know if you'd like a copy to use as your starting template.

### <span style="color:blue; font-weight:bold;">4. Always Check Your USYD Email</span>  
Your USYD email is your lifeline. All official announcements from the uni go there, and yes, that includes important opportunities you won’t want to miss!  
From internship offers and uni events to class updates and admin reminders, they all land in your inbox.  
💡 Pro tip: Check your email at least once a day (even just a quick skim) so you don’t miss out on anything valuable.  
Seriously, some cool stuff shows up out of nowhere!


### <span style="color:blue; font-weight:bold;">5. Check Canvas & Ed Every Single Day</span> 
Two platforms you'll be glued to throughout the semester:  
- Canvas: Your main class dashboard. Here you’ll find: assignment instructions, zoom links & class recordings, assessment/quiz/exam grades, weekly learning materials.  
- Ed: Like a class-specific Q&A forum (linked to Canvas). This is where your lecturers and tutors post updates, answer questions, and where you can ask anything class-related. Even if you’re not the one asking questions, reading through other students' questions can be super helpful. Don’t underestimate it!  

💡 Pro tip: Pin both Canvas and Ed on your browser's bookmark bar so they’re always just one click away.  



You’ve got this! 💪 Trust yourself and enjoy the ride.  
I believe in you ✨
