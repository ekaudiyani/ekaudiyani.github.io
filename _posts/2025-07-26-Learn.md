One of the things that truly amazed me about USYD is how much support the university gives to help students grow, not just academically, but professionally and personally too.  
It honestly feels like the uni cares deeply about us 🥹💙

Here are some powerful tools and resources you can tap into to build your skills and shape your future, starting now:

# <span style="color:blue; font-weight:bold;">Learning Hub</span>  
USYD offers loads of amazing workshops through the [Learning Hub](https://learning-hub.sydney.edu.au/homepage/aclanguage).  
These sessions go beyond what you learn in lectures, they focus on how to learn effectively and tackle assignments like a champ.  
Most sessions are just one hour, and you can join online or in person.

🧠 My top picks for the first few weeks:  

- Lectures and How To Use Them
- Listening and Note Taking
- Reading for Tutorial
- Writing in Academic Style
- Using AI Effectively  
Honestly, these classes made a big difference in how I manage my uni life!


# <span style="color:blue; font-weight:bold;">LinkedIn Learning = Free Motivation + Knowledge</span>
Did you know we get free access to LinkedIn Learning with our USYD UniKey? Use it!  
You’ll find endless videos and short courses on tech, communication, leadership, anything you can think of.


✨ One of my personal favourites is:
“Women Transforming Tech: Tips for Career Success” [click here]((https://www.linkedin.com/learning/women-transforming-tech-tips-for-career-success/career-advice-from-women-transforming-tech?u=2196204))
I love listening to it while doing dishes or sitting on the bus (no shame!).
📲 PS: You also get free access to apps like Zoom, OneDrive, Microsoft 365, and even Copilot!

# <span style="color:blue; font-weight:bold;">Start Building Your Professional Profile Now</span>  
Being a USYD student is already a great achievement, own it!  
But to shine in the job market later, you’ll need a strong professional presence too. Start with your LinkedIn profile:
- Update your education & career milestones  
- Add any cool projects or achievements  
- Make it you, this is your online resume and first impression!  
In the global world, LinkedIn is key for networking and opportunities.

I personally joined an industry experience program during the semester break, thanks to a Careers Centre email.

USYD provides free access to the Sonder app, and trust me, it’s totally worth installing on your phone!
